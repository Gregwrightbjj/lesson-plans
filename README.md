## TIY Lesson Plans

**Hello!** These are the lesson modules for my version of The Iron Yard's front-end engineering class.

These are my speaker notes. They help me organize my thoughts and, in the midst of answering questions and writing code samples, make sure the material presented follows a logical progression. The notes are passed along to the students after any lectures I use them in as part of the review material.

We teach the class in 12 intensive weeks. It comprises 36 three-hour lectures, alongside tons of recitation, homework, and a capstone project. During each lecture, I aim to start -- and finish -- 1-3 of these lesson modules. How those modules are ordered depends on how well the students are picking up certain topics, and what I feel like they'd be most receptive to learning that day.

**If you're also teaching a front-end topic class,** feel free to use and adapt this material (and make pull requests if I'm wrong anywhere!) There's obviously some pre-requisites for almost all lesson modules, which I've tried to map out below.

**If you're learning by yourself along at home,** this content is meant to be illustrative to instructors and experienced developers, and remedial to folks that just recently heard the content presented in a pedagogical setting. You may have some luck using this content as a companion guide to other lessons, and you might also supplement this content with some intensive Googles. 

But your best bet will likely to be to spend time and effort in a more intentionally structured setting. If you're interested in intensive, in-person education, I work here: [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/academy/).
